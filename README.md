# PathFinder

<h3>PathFinder is a web application implementing various shortest pathfinding algorithms in a 2D grid environment.</h3>

The algorithms included till now are:<br/>
1)A* search<br/>
2)IDA* search<br/>
3)Theta* search<br/>
4)Best First Search<br/>
5)Breadth-First Search<br/>
6)Dijkstra's algorithm<br/>
7)K Shortest Paths using Dijkstra's algorithm<br/>

## Usage

  An online demo can be seen [here](https://ritika-11.github.io/mars.rover/).

  You can select an algorithm from the panel on the right side. There are also options available if you want to allow diagonal paths or not, or which heuristic function you want to use to calculate distance.

  Algorithms A*, IDA*, Theta*, and K Shortest Paths run only for one destination. Best First Search, Breadth-First Search, and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm can be used for multiple destinations. 

  Obstacles can be added with mouse drag to make cells impenetrable. Choose if you want to add walls(obstacles) or more destinations using the radio button in the panel. 
  
  Also, algorithms can be compared using the compare algorithms button in the panel where you can see a graphical representation of the shortest path length returned by different algorithms and the number of operations each algorithm takes to return path.
